libdbi-drivers - drivers for libdbi, the Database
Independent Abstraction Layer for C

WINDOWS-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------------

libdbi-drivers can be compiled into DLL files on Win32 with the Cygwin
package, available at http://www.cygwin.com/. libdbi must be properly
installed before attempting to build libdbi-drivers, and you need the
appropriate client libraries of the database engines.

To build a particular driver, run these commands, where:

- XYZ is one of msql, mysql or pgsql for MiniSQL, MySQL, and
  PostgreSQL, respectively

- /path/to/lib is (usually) /usr/local/lib/mysql for MySQL and
  /usr/local/msql3/lib for MiniSQL. The LDFLAGS stuff is not required
  for building the PostgreSQL driver.

./configure --with-driverXYZ
make
make install
make libXYZ-dll -f Makefile.w32 LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib"
make install-libXYZ -f Makefile.w32

If you want to build and install all drivers, use the following commands:
./configure --with-mysql --with-pgsql --with-msql
make
make install
make -f Makefile.w32 LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib/mysql -L/usr/local/msql3/lib"
make install -f Makefile.w32

Note: sqlite has not been included into this port as it utilizes
file locking mechanisms not (yet) supported by Cygwin.


CYGWIN DETAILS:
---------------

There are unfortunately no "Cygwin" releases in a sense as there are Debian 2.2
or FreeBSD 4.5. All components, including the cygwin1.dll, gcc, bash etc. have
their own independent versions. The most important package for the new-style
Makefile to work is the binutils package (linker and such), which should be
"binutils-20011002-1" or newer.


USAGE:
------

Once libdbi is compiled for Win32 and you have a DLL, you can use that DLL like
any other. The only requirement is that the cygwin runtime DLL is available on
the target machine also, since non-Windows API functions are implemented by
cygwin.


MODIFICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTION (GPL):
----------------------------------------

See the file COPYING or http://www.gnu.org for more details.
