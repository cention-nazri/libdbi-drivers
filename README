libdbi-drivers - drivers for libdbi, a database abstraction
layer implemented in C

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the
DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database
connections by using this framework.

libdbi-drivers supplies the drivers that the libdbi framework utilizes
to talk to the supported database servers.



INSTALLATION:
-------------

Perform the regular ./configure, make, make install. See INSTALL for
the generic details of each step. It is important to understand that
you have to request the driver(s) that you want to build on the
configure command line. E.g. to build both the SQLite and the
PostgreSQL drivers, use "./configure --with-sqlite --with-pgsql". See
./configure --help for more libdbi-drivers configuration options.

If you are building the Win32 port, see README.win32.

AVAILABLE DRIVERS:
------------------

* SQLite
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
