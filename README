layer implemented in C

INTRODUCTION:
-------------

libdbi implements a database-independent abstraction layer in C, similar to the
DBI/DBD layer in Perl. Writing one generic set of code, programmers can
leverage the power of multiple databases and multiple simultaneous database
connections by using this framework.

libdbi-drivers supplies additional drivers for databases not covered
by the libdbi core distribution.


INSTALLATION:
-------------

Perform the regular ./configure, make, make install. See INSTALL for the
generic details of each step. Some of the libdbi-specific options to configure
that may interest you are: --with-sqlite. This will enable
compilation of the only database drivers that is available currently.
See ./configure --help for more libdbi-drivers configuration options.

If you are building the Win32 port, see README.win32.

AVAILABLE DRIVERS:
------------------

Currently there is just the sqlite driver. This driver allows to run
applications linked against libdbi without an external database
engine.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:
--------------------

libdbi-drivers has been written with cross-platform availability in
mind. To date, chances are it is going to run with:

Linux: Debian, RedHat, Slackware
Windows: 98, NT4, 2000 -- see README.win32
FreeBSD: 4.3 through 4.7
SunOS: 2.8
Solaris: 7
AIX: 4.2, 4.3 and 5.1

If you are using libdbi on a platform not listed here, please notify the
mailing list! (see below)


MODIFICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTION (GPL):
----------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION:
--------------

README.drivers covers most of the basic questions. doc/manual.pdf has a
somewhat more elaborate description of how to use the sqlite driver.
