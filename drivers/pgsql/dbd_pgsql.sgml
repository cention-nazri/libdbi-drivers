	<para>
		<ulink url="&www-libdbi;">libdbi</ulink> is a database abstraction
		layer written in C. It implements a framework that can utilize
		separate driver libraries for specific database servers. The <ulink
		url="&www;">libdbi-drivers</ulink> project provides the drivers
		necessary to talk to the supported database servers.
	</para>
	<para>
		This manual provides information about the pgsql driver, which
		provides support for PostgreSQL database servers. The manual is
		intended for programmers who write applications linked against libdbi
		and who want their applications to work with this driver.
	</para>
	<para>
		Questions and comments about this driver should be sent to the
		libdbi-drivers-devel mailing list (see the <ulink
		url="&www;">website</ulink>). Questions and comments about the libdbi
		library should be sent to the appropriate libdbi mailing list.

	<section id="install-build"><title>Build and install the driver</title>
		<para>
			First you have to unpack the libdbi-drivers archive in a suitable
			directory. Unpacking will create a new subdirectory <filename
			class="directory">libdbi-drivers-X.Y.Z</filename> where "X.Y.Z"
			denotes the version:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>tar -xzf libdbi-drivers-0.3.tar.gz</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			The libdbi-drivers project consists of several drivers that use a
			common build system. Therefore you <emphasis>must</emphasis> tell
			configure explicitly that you want to build the sqlite driver (you
			can list as many drivers as you want to build):
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd libdbi-drivers</userinput></screen>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-&dbd-name;</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			Run <command>./configure --help</command> to find out about
			additional options and other available drivers.
		</para>
		<para>
			Then build the driver with the command:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput></screen>
		<note>
			<para>
				Please note that you may have to invoke
				<command>gmake</command>, the GNU version of make, on some
				systems.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
			Then install the driver with the command (you'll need root
			permissions to do this):
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			To test the operation of the newly installed driver, use the
			command:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			This command creates and runs a test program that performs a few
			basic input and output tests. The program will ask for a database
			name. This can be any name that is a valid filename on your
			system. It will also ask for a data directory. This is the
			directory that is used to create the test database. Needless to
			say that you need write access to that directory. If you accept
			the default ".", the database will be created in the <filename
			class="directory">tests</filename> subdirectory.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				If for some reason you need to re-create the
				autoconf/automake-related files, try running <command
				moreinfo="none">./autogen.sh</command>. I've found out that
				the current stable autoconf/automake/libtool versions (as
				found in FreeBSD 4.7 and Debian 3.0) do not cooperate well, so
				I found it necessary to run the older autoconf 2.13. If
				necessary, edit <filename
				moreinfo="none">autogen.sh</filename> so that it will catch
				the older autoconf version on your system.
			</para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="options"><title>Driver options</title>
	<para>
		Your application has to initialize libdbi drivers by setting some
		driver options with the <function>dbi_conn_set_option()</function> and
		the <function>dbi_conn_set_option_numeric()</function> library
		functions. In contrast to most other drivers, the sqlite driver
		supports only the following options (the other common options are
		meaningless due to the embedded nature of the database engine):
	</para>
	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>dbname</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The name of the database you want to work with. As a
					SQLite database corresponds to one file in your
					filesystem, <varname>dbname</varname> can be any legal
					filename. If the database/file doesn't exist when you
					first try to access it, SQLite will create it on the fly.
				</para>
				<para>
					It is important to understand that the full path of the
					database is composed of <varname>sqlite-dbdir</varname>
					and <varname>dbname</varname>. Therefore
					<varname>dbname</varname> should not contain the full path
					of a file, but just the name.
				</para>
			</listitem>
		</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
</chapter>

<chapter id="specific"><title>PostgreSQL-specific Peculiarities</title>
	<para>
		This chapter lists known peculiarities of the sqlite driver. This
		includes SQLite features that differ from what you know from the other
		database servers supported by libdbi, and it includes features and
		misfeatures introduced by the sqlite driver. It is the intention of
		the driver author to reduce the number of misfeatures in future
		releases if possible.
