	<para>
		<ulink url="&www-libdbi;">libdbi</ulink> is a database abstraction
		layer written in C. It implements a framework that can utilize
		separate driver libraries for specific database servers. The <ulink
		url="&www;">libdbi-drivers</ulink> project provides the drivers
		necessary to talk to the supported database servers.
	</para>
	<para>
		This manual provides information about the &dbd-name; driver, which
		provides support for &proper-name; databases. The manual is
		intended for programmers who write applications linked against libdbi
		and who want their applications to use this database backend.
	</para>
	<para>
		Questions and comments about this driver should be sent to the
		libdbi-drivers-devel mailing list (see the <ulink
		url="&www;">website</ulink>). Questions and comments about the libdbi
		library should be sent to the appropriate libdbi mailing list.

		is an advanced relational database management system
		from Ingres Corporation. Notable features include C2 security certification,
		clustering, partitioning, transaction journaling, query optimisation, 
		diverse programming bindings and flexible licensing from GPL community 
		through to 24/7 enterprise level support.

		This chapter describes the prerequisites and the procedures to build

			The following packages must be installed on your system:

			<varlistentry>
				<term>libdbi</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						This library implements the core database abstraction
						layer, which provides your application with database
						backend functionality when paired with this driver.
						More information about libdbi, including mailing
						lists, documentation, bug reports, and downloads, is
						available from the <ulink url="&www-libdbi;">libdbi
						website</ulink>.

						RDBMS.

					<para>
						The current version of the dbd_ingres driver was
						written and tested with the 32-bit NPTL version II 9.0.4
						for Linux/x86, running on Gentoo

	<section id="install-build"><title>Build and install the driver</title>
		<para>
			First you have to unpack the libdbi-drivers archive in a suitable
			directory. Unpacking will create a new subdirectory with the
			version number, such as <filename
			class="directory">libdbi-drivers-0.8.0</filename>
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>tar xfvz libdbi-drivers-0.8.0.tar.gz</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			The libdbi-drivers project consists of several drivers that use a
			common build system. Therefore you <emphasis>must</emphasis> explicitly tell
			the configuration script that you want to build the &dbd-name; driver (you
			can list as many drivers as you want to build):
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>cd libdbi-drivers-0.8.0</userinput></screen>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>./configure --with-&dbd-name;</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			Run <command>./configure --help</command> to find out about
			additional options and other available drivers.
		</para>
		<para>
			Then build the driver with the command:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make</userinput></screen>
		<note>
			<para>
				Please note that you may have to invoke
				<command>gmake</command>, the GNU version of make, on some
				systems.
			</para>
		</note>
		<para>
			Then install the driver with the command (you'll need root
			permissions to do this):
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			To test the operation of the newly installed driver, use the
			command:
		</para>
		<screen><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>
		<para>
			This command creates and runs a test program that performs a few
			basic input and output tests.
		</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				If for some reason you need to re-create the
				autoconf/automake-related files, try running <command
				moreinfo="none">./autogen.sh</command>. In some situations,
				the current stable autoconf/automake/libtool versions (as
				found in FreeBSD 4.7 and Debian 3.0) do not cooperate well, so
				it may be necessary to run the older autoconf 2.13. If
				necessary, edit <filename
				moreinfo="none">autogen.sh</filename> so that it will catch
				the older autoconf version on your system.
			</para>

<chapter id="options"><title>Driver options</title>
	<para>
		Before you can initiate a connection, you must usually specify options
		that tell the database driver what to connect to. This driver supports
		the standard options of
		<varname>username</varname>, <varname>password</varname> and
		<varname>dbname</varname>. The latter parameter is in Ingres syntax,
		[node_id::]dbname[/svr_class] - see Ingres documentation for details.
		(When running as the Ingres admin user on the same host as the DBMS,
		only the dbname is normally required.)
		Sensible defaults will be used for all unspecified options.
	</para>
	<para>
		This driver also offers the following non-standard options, and/or
		redefines the meaning of the following standard options:
	</para>
	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
			<term>ingres_autocommit</term>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					'Autocommit' mode
					is enabled by default for the Ingres DBMS connection.
					In this mode, every query is committed as an individual transaction.
					With autocommit disabled (0), a transaction is begun at
					connection, and must be committed or rolled back
					explicitly (see Ingres OpenAPI and SQL references for more
					information).
				</para>
			</listitem>

	</variablelist>
</chapter>

<chapter id="specific"><title>&proper-name;-specific Peculiarities</title>
	<para>
		This chapter lists known peculiarities of the &dbd-name; driver.
		Wherever possible, nonstandard driver behavior is hidden by libdbi's
		abstractions, but occasionally special considerations must be taken or
		extra functionality may be utilized for particular drivers.
