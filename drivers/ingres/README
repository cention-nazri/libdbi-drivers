INGRES DRIVER:
--------------

This driver allows libdbi-enabled applications to use Ingres(R) as a database
backend. Internally, it provides a libdbi driver around the Ingres OpenAPI 
client library.

See the included driver documentation for installation instructions, usage,
and information about driver-specific peculiarities.

Tested with the Ingres 2006 Community Edition release 9.0.4 on Gentoo Linux/x86.

For more information about the Ingres(R) open source RDBMS, see http://ingres.com/

STATUS
