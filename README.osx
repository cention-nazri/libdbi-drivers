OSX-SPECIFIC INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------------

Installing libdbi-drivers on OSX can be easily accomplished by bending
over backwards while jumping through a burning hoop. This is the
recommended procedure to achieve this feat:

/sw/bin/glibtoolize --force
aclocal
automake --add-missing
autoconf
./configure --with-mysql --with-pgsql --with-sqlite --with-pgsql-dir=/opt/local/pgsql LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib"
./fixlt.sh
make
sudo make install

The fixlt.sh script is shipped with libdbi-drivers. It is required to
fix the libtool script created by configure for libtool versions
1.4.x. libtool versions 1.5.x should not require this hack.

Please note that you may have to adapt some paths depending on where
your stuff is installed.
